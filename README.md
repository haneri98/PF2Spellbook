# PF2Spellbook
Simple spell book webapp for Pathfinder 2nd Edition.

Uses Archives of Nethys website to screenshot spell information, catalouge it, and store it locally for quicker access (because AoN is slow).

Meant for personal use. If one wishes to use it, one needs to change some path values and pixel RGB values in the python script, if needed.
